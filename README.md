# CSC-111
A collection of Python assignments and projects that were created for Smith College's Fall 2019 semester of "Introduction to Computer Science", taught by Joseph O'Rourke. 

Alongside various projects that I've completed for this course, I may also feature assignments that I added extra steps to, for further practice using Python.
